Software Quality and Testing

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

By having different types of tests throug out the software lifecyle development. Using unit tests, integrationtests, and system tests allow
the program to have different levels of testing of the code and how the code interacts with another set of code.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
By getting as much detail from the customer as possible I can start to inplement user needs as requirements. Through out the software develpoment there is a need 
to keep the requirements as close to user needs as possible by keeping in contact with the customer through each itteration in the development and disscuss if a 
requirement is not possible or is redundant. 

**How do I approach designing software?**
With an open mind set to the customer's requirements and vision to the program. A willingness to be thorough in testing the program though each stage in the
software's lifecycle and evelove the coding though out the lifecycle in response to customer changes and feedback.
